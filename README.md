## What is Pwekish?
Pwekish (TolontenPw√©k) is a language spoken in the Isles of Pwek. It is listed as one of the national languages of United Ingland, where it is the historical major native language of the region. Pwekish belongs to the Pwekian language family, which has no clear relationship with other major language families of the world. Pwekish consists of a large amount of Chinese vocabularies, borrowed from the Chinese language throughout the years. However, Pwekish is undergoing a process of language revival, which replaces many of the loanwords with newly coined Pwekish words, a process similar to the use of Anglish.
