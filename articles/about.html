            <h3>What is Pwekish?</h3>
            <p>
                Pwekish is a constructed language created by CheckedMorrow and InglandThiccLi. 
                It belongs to the Pwekian language family, which has no clear relationship with other major language families of the world. 
                It also exhibits a special grammatical structure and exotic set of root words.
                For instance, Pwekish is an agglutinative language, which allows the stacking of word elements for the formation of long words,
                enabling many Pwekish-originated words to be derived from a small set of basic root words. 
                Besides, Pwekish has total 4 different writing system, which are “BentolRomak”, “Punloy BentolPwek”, “Kentan BentolPwek”, and “Handzi”. 
                The later 3 are often used together in a text while “BentolRomak” is often used alone.
                All these makes Pwekish a distinct language.
