            <h3>What is Pwekish?</h3>
            <p>
                Pwekish is a constructed language developed by CheckedMorrow and InglandThiccLi. 
				It belongs to the Pwekian language family, which has no direct ties to any major language families worldwide. 
				Characterized by its unique grammatical structure and an exotic array of root words, Pwekish is an agglutinative language. 
				This means it allows for the combination of word elements to create long, complex words, 
				enabling a wide variety of Pwekish-originated terms to emerge from a limited set of basic roots.
            </p>
			<p>
				Additionally, Pwekish features four distinct writing systems: “BentolRomak,” “Punloy BentolPwek,” “Kentan BentolPwek,” and “Handzi.” 
				The latter three are often used in conjunction within texts, while “BentolRomak” is typically employed on its own. 
				These elements contribute to the distinctiveness of the Pwekish language.
			</p>

				Thank you for visiting, and we look forward to accompanying you on your linguistic journey! 🌍✨
